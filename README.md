# predict-recidivism
Analyses for a study on the potential of dynamic and static risk factors to predict recidivism in Finland. This study is currently under peer review and under revision (2018-03-13).

Current version can be found as a preprint on https://psyarxiv.com/v5uq3/

I am currently restructuring the files into a R package structure for clearer presentation and better reproducibility. For now, analyses are best followed via the R Markdown files 1_, 2_ and 3_ in the analyses folder.
